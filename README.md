This is the first Groovy Challenge I've completed, along with some commented out excercises. 

The Challenge is as follows:

* Read all lines of every file found in the resources directory.
* Capture all numbers in a List while omitting other entries.
* Determine highest number in List and print it.
* Add all numbers in List and print sum.
